# hash-calculator

This Python tool consists in a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application using the Tkinter library for calculating hash values of input strings. The application allows you to choose from various hashing algorithms (such as blake2b, md5, sha256, etc.), input a string, and generate the corresponding hash value. The tool includes features like auto-update, an option to copy the hash to the clipboard, and an exit confirmation dialog.
